# Enogine (Eno Engine)
A game engine used by [techacol](https://github.com/enocodee/techacol) is written in Zig.

> [!HIGHLIGHT]
> I (aka Hung Pham) also plan to develop this engine into a general-purpose game engine for Zig community so if you come when the project is still in early stages, feel free to fork or open an issue to contribute.
